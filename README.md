# redux-toolkit-project

I created this application to learn Redux Toolkit. It is a simple application pretending to be a store, or more precisely, the basket itself in which our products are counted. We can remove all products, change the number of individual products, or remove a specific product. Of course, the price is automatically calculated and changes with the number of products in the basket. Additionally, I added options to confirm product deletion using a modal.
